# netflix_fast_example_app

A repository for an examination of the performance difference between [ActiveModelSerializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) and Netflix's [fast_jsonapi](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi) for the JSON serialization layer.

Additionally, this is a test bed for me to understand how Netflix is using their fast_jsonapi serializers and [restful-jsonapi](https://github.com/Netflix/restful-jsonapi)
